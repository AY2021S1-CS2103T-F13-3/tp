## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `MediBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagramUpdated.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the medi book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

**Patient**

The `Patient`,
* stores `IC`, `Name`, `DateOfBirth` and `Phone` objects that represent the patient's IC number, name, date of birth and phone number respectively.
* stores `Optionals` of `Address`, `Email`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Bmi` and `BloodType` objects.
* `Bmi` is automatically computed and stored within Optional if both `Height` and `Weight` are present.


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the medi book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding medical notes to patients

#### Implementation

* Each medical note is stored as a `MedicalNote` object.
* Every `patient` has a `MedicalNoteList` object that represents the list of medical notes belonging to that `patient`.
* `NoteCommandParser` parses user's string input into a `NoteCommand`
* Target `patient` is retrieved from `ModelManager#getPatientToAccess()`

The following sequence diagram shows how note adding operation works:

![NoteSequenceDiagramMain](images/NoteSequenceDiagramFocusLogic.png)

![NoteSequenceDiagramSD](images/NoteSequenceDiagramSDUpdatePatientInModel.png)

#### Design consideration

`note` command can only be called when viewing a `patient`'s profile
* A medical records software contains many `patients`, each with potentially many `medical note`s.
* Every `patient` in the `model` has a `MedicalNoteList` that is initialised as an empty list at program start-up to optimise start-up time.
* `MedicalNoteList` of every patient is properly loaded only when necessary (`access` on patient)
* `access`-ing a `patient` loads the stored medical note list and sets the `MedicalNoteList` of the `patient` to the retrieved list
* Hence, `note` command can only be called when viewing a `patient`'s profile as it ensures that the `MedicalNoteList` has already been properly loaded by executing `access` command beforehand
* It also allows for a shorter `note` command as the user does not need to specify a target `patient`.

### \[Proposed\] Account Creation and Login

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed account creation feature is facilitated by a new `CreateAccountCommand`. It extends `Command`, similar to how all the other commands currently work.

![CreateAccountSequenceDiagram](images/CreateAccountSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `create u/example_username p/example_password`.

Step 2. `Logic#execute(String commandText)` creates a new `CreateAccountCommand` and calls `Storage#saveNewAccountDetails()`.

Step 3. `Storage#saveNewAccountDetails()` converts the new account's username and password into json format and saves it a `AccountDetails.json` file.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command to create account.

![CreateAccountActivityDiagram](images/CreateAccountActivityDiagram.png)

The proposed login feature is facilitated by a new `LoginWindow` class in the UI.

![LoginSequenceDiagram](images/LoginSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user inputs his/her login information.

Step 2. The UI calls `Logic#login()` with the login information as input.

Step 3. `Logic#login()` then calls `Storage#checkAccountDetails()` on the login information, to check if the information matches any of the account details saved.

Step 4. If there is no match, an error is thrown. If there is a match, the UI then changes from `LoginWindow` to `MainWindow`, which signifies that the user has succesfully logged in.
